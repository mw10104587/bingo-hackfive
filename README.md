How Bingo player plays in the Presidential Campaign?
by HACK FIVE


Can you imagine a group of Bingo Players from Michigan donating more money than employees from the Ford Motor Company, or that about one out of every 25 dollars from individual contributions in the State came from Bingo Players? Then you might begin to understand the role of bingo players in the presidential campaign.


Nearly a thousand donations in Michigan came from locals who listed “Bingo Player” as either their occupation or employer in FEC filings. Based on players Facebook pages, they are a majority female and seniors living in or near Oakland County. Looking into the group, we found all games were run by the Oakland County Democratic Party in Green Acres Bingo Hall. A call to OCDP Bingo revealed that they host Bingo multiple times a day. According to the OCDP, the winners donate their money at will and are not required to donate.  


Another interesting point in this group is all donations on record stopped by the end of April, however the games are still going on everyday.  A look at individuals who listed themselves at Bingo Players showed that they continued to donate similar amounts after April, but listed their occupation and employer as none, suggesting they are merely changing how they are filing the donations.  


From January to April $237,215 has been donated by Bingo Players – all to democrats. If donations continue at that rate, these bingo players will have have donated well over a million dollars by election day.
