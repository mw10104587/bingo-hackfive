Can you imagine a group of Bingo Players from Michigan donating more money than employees from the Ford Motor Company, or that about one out of every 25 dollars from individual contributions in the State came from Bingo Players? Then you might begin to understand the role of bingo players in the presidential campaign.

Nearly a thousand donations in Michigan came from locals who listed “Bingo Player” as either their occupation or employer in FEC filings. Based on players Facebook pages, they are a majority female and seniors living in or near Oakland County. Looking into the group, we found all games were run by the Oakland County Democratic Party in Green Acres Bingo Hall. A call to OCDP Bingo revealed that they host Bingo multiple times a day. According to the OCDP, the winners donate their money at will and are not required to donate.  

Another interesting point in this group is all donations on record stopped by the end of April, however the games are still going on everyday.  A look at individuals who listed themselves at Bingo Players showed that they continued to donate similar amounts after April, but listed their occupation and employer as none, suggesting they are merely changing how they are filing the donations.  


From January to April $237,215 has been donated by Bingo Players – all to democrats. If donations continue at that rate, these bingo players will have have donated well over a million dollars by election day.  

<h3> Data </h3>
the data we use[https://github.com/mw10104587/bingo-hackfive/blob/gh-pages/data/FEC_data.csv]

This is a piece of dirty data, with a lot of missing cells. We used SQL, R and Python to discover the data.


Ji Liu: Team coordinator, formed the team of Journalism,  Computer Science and Statistics background team members; 
        Data miner, looked into the FEC data set and form the story line with other team members; 
        Story reporter, interviewed Oakland Bingo Hall and drafted the story.
        
Chi-An Wang: Data engineer, programmed Python Script and R Script to browse through the FEC data;
             Data visualizationist, visualized data with d3.js library;
             Front-end developer, built the website;
             Front-end developer, designed the website.

Stephan Bisaha: Data engineer, used SQL queries to find insight from the data.
                Story editor, edit the captions and story.
                Data visualizationist, visualized data into bar chart by using R
                


<h4>what you've discover</h4>
By looking into data, we found around 1,000 people named themselves as "Bingo Players" are ranked very high in national transactions for presidential campaign. All their money went to Democrats. They suddenly stopped using "Bingo Player" as their occupation in the end of April, however same people are still donating. We also see the similar amount pattern from the donors.
By interviewing Oakland Bingo Hall, JI found Oakland County  organized this bingo game everyday, but they said the donation is not compulsory. However, the officer refused to give the exact number of people involved.

<h4>what tools we've used</h4>
Data mining: Excel spreadsheet, SQL, Python and R
Front-end: Javascript, html, css, heroku


<h4>What you learned </h4>
When dealing with a big dataset with a lot of missing data, you cannot remove all data or we will skew the result. A better way is to look into some outliers, and find some interesting stories behind it.

<h4>Future plan for this story<h4>
We will dig into the reasons why suddenly donors change their occupation from "Bingo Player" to none; does this bingo game related to money laundry; what's the record in the past years; and how can we predict the overall influence of these bingo players in 2016 campaign? Are there bingo groups in other counties?
